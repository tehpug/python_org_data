https://wiki.python.org/moin/JimD,3,visited,text/html,"A colleague has recently been thrust into Python programming because we needed to create our own tools around some of the Opsware tools and using their APIs. He was asked a question about whether it's a sin to not include `if __name__ == '__main__':` in a Python file, which he found confusing. The guidelines provided by Jim Dennis for this scenario are: files with no meaningful standalone purpose should include `if __name__ == '__main__':`, and files that are NOT executable should include it, but the code is harmless if they're in a .py file or on the PYTHONPATH. Python syntax does not require an `if __name__` check for proper usage.","Python, programming, coding, module, script"

https://wiki.python.org/moin/TestHarnessDesign,3,visited,text/html,"Over the next couple of hours a wrote a crude shell (in Python) for sending commands and key sequences to the phone, and reading back raw serial responses and screens back. While crude this shell does offer command editing and history (via readline) with automatically persistent history, it saves logs of all output to the phone (seperate logs for raw serial commands and for the key sequences which are embedded therein) and all input read back from the phone (again in separate streams, for raw characters read from the device and for each screenshot I take), and it allows me to insert comments into the history and log files (so I can take notes in the shell that I can correlate to specific entries in the logs). Also my crude interactive shell uses the optparse module to initialize my serial connection (different phones have different speeds and are connected to different ports --- I have an 8-port Moxa board installed on the Linux desktop workstation). I also played a littled with ConfigParser so I could store most of the connection details and log file names in an .ini file and just call my script with a label representing which phone/port I want to play with. So that was about four hours of scripting. My boss was impressed, but really it's only about 150 lines of code. PySerial, readline, and ConfigParser are really doing all of the work. I'm not so easily impressed with myself. That was just some throwaway scripting to help me understand the tools. There's no design, and I didn't see an easy way to use this shell's artifacts (log files) to automate any sort of playback. Also a lack of loop and condition handling makes it unsuitable for doing things like adding 99 entries to the phone's built-in address book, validate that they're all there, ensure that it gives this particular error when you try to add another, etc. (I wrote that up as another, stand alon shell script, which is still semi-blind and offers almost no code reuse). My point in posting all this is to solicit advice on a robust design for a real test harness. I'm reasonably good at scripting but not experienced in design and have almost no formal CS training.","Python, Scripting, Test Harness, Serial Communication, Key Sequences, Command Editing, Log Files, Condition Handling"

I developed the first IDG Brasil dynamic news site in Zope in early 1999. After founding and managing a pioneering Zope company in Brazil (Hiperlogic 1999-2003), I decided to focus on training and education. I am now a senior instructor at Simples Consultoria. I am the author of a popular Portuguese-language short tutorial which teaches basic programming with Python, Aprenda a Programar (Learn to program). Also, I led the team who translated How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python to Portuguese (translation). Recently I created the Turing Club to promote computer programming as a hobby, and between March-May of 2007 we held our first public workshop at SESC Pinheiros, a major culture and arts center in São Paulo. I am now a 4th-year undergrad student of Library Sciences at the Universidade de São Paulo.

https://wiki.python.org/jython/MethodDispatch,3,visited,text/html,"One pattern of ensuring that a Jython base class implemented in Java can call an @ExposedMethod that has potentially been overridden in Python is to have a pair of methods on the base class: a public method named for the method to be overridden by the derived class and an @ExposedMethod declared as final that is available in python. Then, the derived class overrides the super class method in the standard fashion, i.e., 'it will check for the existence of a (Python) method redefining (the exposed name of) that method. If it fails to find one, it calls the version in the principal class (using the super keyword in Java). If it finds a Python re-definition, it invokes that using PyObject.__call__().' This is done by using the rest directive in the derived template - e.g., a typical implementation is: base_class: PyDefaultDict want_dict: true ctr: incl: dict rest: public PyObject __missing__(PyObject key) { PyType self_type= getType(); PyObject impl=self_type.lookup(""__missing__""); if (impl!=null) { return impl.__get__(this,self_type).__call__(key); } return super().__missing__(key); } So, the base class now defines an @ExposedMethod: @ExposedMethod final PyObject defaultdict___missing__(PyObject key) { if (defaultFactory == Py.None) { throw KeyError(key); } return defaultFactory__.__call__(); } and the public method calls the @ExposedMethod directly like: public PyObject __missing__(PyObject key) { return defaultdict___missing__(key); } So, if any method in the base class calls the public method it will result in standard Java dynamic method dispatch to a Py*Derived class if the instance in question has derived from the base class and that will call the overridden python method if it exists or default back to the base classes implementation via super.","@ExposedMethod, Java, Python, Base Class, Derived Class, Dynamic Method Dispatch"

As part of the 2.5 process, we're going through and converting the valuable tests into unittest. TestCases like our main body of tests, and discarding the ones whose time has passed. Tests of using and extending Java should be added to Lib/test/test_java_integration.py. Any Java code used by the test should be moved to tests/java. For tests of Python features, first check if the test is valid for Python 2.5. If it's no longer supported in Python, just delete it and make a note of why you deleted it. If it is valid, check if there's an equivalent test in Lib/test or CPythonLib/test. If so, delete it and note why. If a test doesn't meet any of those criteria, then it should be migrated into a test file for the module it's testing in Lib/test. The general naming convention for tests like this should be test_<module name>_jy.py. Since there's usually already a test in CPythonLib for a given module, _jy is appended to allow them all run side by side. If a _jy test already exists for the module, just migrate this test into it. If not, create a new _jy test for it in the style of test_str_jy or test_dict_jy. Tests that raise support.TestWarning are for bugs that have been identified but not yet fixed. It's probably worth asking if the problem it's hiding is worth fixing or if the test should just be tossed. Tests 1-75 have already been migrated, but 76-400 remain to be done.","jython, python"
